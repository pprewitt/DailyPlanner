# DailyPlanner

The assigment was to create a daily planner, which includes:
   
   *entries for each hour
   *date display for current day/date
   *color styling for current, past, future hours
   *use of local storage to store plan activities

## Discussion

I indexed this poorly to start and then just kept trying to support a poor index method with my code. I changed the indexing and made my life easier. added hover effects for the save button and a little bit longer day, as my days are longer while I am taking this class. 


## Deployment

This site is deployed within github pages (https://pprewitt.github.io/DailyPlanner/)
